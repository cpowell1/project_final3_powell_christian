      <p>Accommodations will be selected by our staff for your pet based upon his/her individual needs, personality, and current availability. And every accommodation at The Farm comes complete with all the amenities you would expect from a 5-star hotel including room service, daily cleaning service, in-suite TVs and hi-fi sound system, climate-controlled fresh air system, and comfortable beds.</p>
      <p>At Peyton's Place, we do everything in our power to make sure our guests are as relaxed and as comfortable as possible. In addition to what we provide, you are welcome to bring your pet’s own “special” things — whatever you believe will enhance your pet’s stay.</p>

      <h2>Grooming</h2>
      <img src="img/grooming.jpg" alt="boarding" />
      <p>The bathery was created with a focus on the wellbeing of pets in every aspect. After extensive research, the Salon was equipped with a Hydro-Surge massaging bath system, and then stocked with Aroma Paws shampoos and conditioners. These products are all-natural and oatmeal-based, which means that they are gentle on even the most sensitive skin. They come in a variety of natural scents—or fragrance-free. Our goal is to create what we call “Stress-Free Bathing.”</p>
