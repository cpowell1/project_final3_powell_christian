##Resources
 * [Parallax Image Scroll](https://github.com/pederan/Parallax-ImageScroll)
  * This plugin is on my homepage. It adds interactivity as the user scrolls. They can see the images of the business and dogs playing along with information about Peyton's Place.

 * [BeefUp jQuery Plugin](https://github.com/Schascha/BeefUp)
  * This plugin is found on the sections of the services page. The plugin keeps the information from being cluttered by grouping the descriptions and prices under the package name. The user can click on the package name and this information is revealed.
 
 * [Monthly Calendar jQuery Plugin](https://github.com/kthornbloom/Monthly/wiki/Events)
  * This plugin is on the events page. It allows users to scroll through the months to see upcoming events at Peyton's Place.

 * [HTML Tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp)
  * This resource helped me create a table for my desktop footer. I created three sections with the rows and columns so that the information would stay in line as the width increased. 

 * [Font Awesome](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome_icons_brand.asp)
 	* This resource allowed me to link to their social icons that are seen in my footer. The site walked me through how to apply the icon tag and link to the specific social icons that I wanted to use.
 
 * [jQuery Fading Effect](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_fade.asp)
  * This resource was used to help me create my custom jQuery coding. I used the fading effect on my h2 headings on every page. As these headings are moused over, the fade out then back onto the page for interactivity.

 * My Javascript custom code is found in the contact form. When the submit button is pressed, a thank you message appears as it is appended to the form.

##Deductions
 * I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus. 

###Comments
 * I think this project was easier than the resume assignment because we had more practice. I really did like the see all of the concepts we have learned come together. I also can tell that I noticed how much unnecessary CSS and HTML I was using before this class.
